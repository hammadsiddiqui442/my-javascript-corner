# My JavaScript Docs
This repo will contain all my JavaScript learnings and docs.

## Step-00 : Print
- `\n` use for new line 
- `\t` use for Tab
- `/t` and `/n` reads as a word
- you can not write `""` in the `""`
- you can write single `''` and in which doule `""`
- OR you can write as well this double `""` in which `''`

## Step-01 : Variables
- use `var` `name` and print by console
- use `var` `name` and print in console by name three times by adding `+` `concatenation`
- use `var` `name` and print name in console in three seprate lines by adding `\n`
- use `var` `name` and print in console in three seprate line by adding `"\n"`
- use `var` `myString`, `myInteger` `myFloat` `myBoolean`
- use in `console` tpeof `(myString, myInteger, myFloat, myBoolean)`
